                <p class="reading-width">With reference images, the classic VW bus was modelled with subdivision 3D
                    modelling techniques then modified to fit the cartoon proportions. The VW bus uses a forward
                    kinematics
                    rig consists of 5 hinged doors and 2 wheel axels. The style is an older rusted/beat up VW Bus.</p>

                <p class="reading-width">Terrain is created with the help of a NASA EarthData dataset named “ASTER
                    Global Digital Elevation
                    Model V003” of Death Valley California. Stitched together with 9 tiles and used as displacement map,
                    it will show up as the result below. The terrain is then turned into a mesh for easier asset
                    creation and reference since displacement only shows up upon render. With texture from Maptiler
                    gathered and stitched together more than 500 tiles by a custom script, the terrain can be mapped
                    with real RGB color with a max resolution of 32k * 32k.</p>

                    weights are carefully considered as this is a relatively large model to skin. After painting only
                    the body, weights are transferred to hair and clothing with skin weight copy function.</p>

                <h3>Managed rendering + final image production</h3>
                <p class="reading-width">There were several decisions I made considering render times to keep each frame
                    at most less than 90 seconds with an RTX 2070 MaxQ or a GTX 1080TI. I chose the resolution of
                    1920*800 because this will save more than 25% of the pixels from being rendered. This resolution is
                    also a standard in cinema with an aspect ratio of 2.40:1. The usage of 24fps + motion blur is also
                    to save frames required to be rendered while also giving the animation a film look. Rendered on
                    Arnold's then "Stable" Arnold GPU, several bugs appeared including the inability to use Optix
                    Denoiser on render sequence images, Arnold curvature node mess-ups, and frequent crashes/lockups.
                    NOICE denoiser also does not have the necessary variance filter support to complete denoising.</p>
                <h4>Denoising</h4>
                <p class="reading-width">Since our fast render times relied on getting a grainy image then denoising it,
                    not having both of Arnold's built-in denoising option, Optix and NOICE, in GPU mode is a pain. To
                    solve this, I researched and used Intel Open Image Denoise. The problem is that Intel's open image
                    denoise does not support EXR images, only PFM. So, by using the HDR version of ImageMagick and a
                    command-line script, denoising can happen despite Arnold GPU. AOVs were rendered but they did not
                    help that much as they are also quite noisy.</p>

                <p class="reading-width">At the end of the project, this film received one of the highest grade in
                    the class with it being shown as a demonstration of what could be done in later semesters. There are
                    several things could have done differently. First, the texture for the terrain is really not very
                    critical to be high resolution as it can not fit on the gpu anyway. The terrain could be overly
                    detailed and be reduced in complexity further away from the camera. Also, somehow with color
                    grading, a night color scheme should be more reinforced.</p>
