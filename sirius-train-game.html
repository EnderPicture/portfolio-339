                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p class="reading-width">The Serius Train Game is a 2d side scroller built to allow players to enjoy the
                    scenery while controlling one of 3 types of trains. With each type of train, the player is exposed
                    to more and more control from the bullet train to the steam train. As the train engineer, the player
                    needs to control the train with elegance, smoothness, and punctuality so the passengers stay happy.
                    Developed for the class IAT410 Advanced game design working in a team of 4, we are tasked to create
                    an intriguing game within the allotted three-month semester time frame. In the end, we won a
                    “Certificate of Excellence in Game Design” from a panel of industry judges.</p>
                <p class="reading-width">Created for SFU's Fall 2019 class of IAT 410 - Advanced Game Design.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>

                <p class="reading-width">The game started very differently. The team and I have ideated about a similar
                    game to keep talking and nobody explodes but in single-player, something about challenging
                    multitasking skills. The initial idea was the player being someone new to a space-age power station
                    and them needing to deal with a reactor core meltdown in the first-person mode. Spending almost half
                    of our allotted time on this idea with prototypes and player testing done, we have found that the
                    game is hard to expand on the idea and reach a cohesive narrative requirement. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="mid">

                <p class="reading-width">I always wanted to build a train game so I suggested the idea of pivoting to my
                    team. Through a day of brainstorming with the new idea still integrating the previous core
                    mechanics. Instead of being in the first-person mode, the player is in the third person view looking
                    at a flat-shaded vector drawing of a train. Being backlit, the art team does not need to worry about
                    background items being simple or brush strokes. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="mid">

                <p class="reading-width">I was mainly in charge of programming tasks, unity post effects, and graphics
                    of the train. I worked closely with the art team to create the background and foreground elements as
                    well as the character animations. I also worked closely with the audio technician to implement
                    immersive audio experiences.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p class="reading-width">Some challenges I faced are about game balancing, with many values working in
                    tandem, it is very difficult to find the optimum value for an enjoyable gaming experience. It is
                    also difficult to debug each value change as this is a slow game and speeding it up will not give
                    the same feel. We overcame this by having many people playtest this game and provide feedback with
                    interactive development techniques</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="reading-width">In the end, I believe the resulting product was what I could have hoped for in
                    such a small time frame with it winning the top prize of “Certificate of Excellence in Game Design”
                    at the end of the semester with a panel of industry expert judges.</p>

                <h2>Awards</h2>
                <p class="reading-width">With a panel of industry judges, our game won the "Certificate of Excellence in
                    Game Design" and "Winning the Best Game (Champion)" award.</p>
